- **Dynamic Lighting System** - Real-time lighting using Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBOs)
- **OpenTK Integration** - Leveraging modern OpenGL capabilities through OpenTK

### 💾 Engine Architecture
- **GUID-based Entity System** - Robust object identification and referencing
- **DTO Serialization** - Clean separation between runtime and serialized data
- Extensible component-based architecture

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project serves as a practical exploration of:
- Real-time 3D rendering techniques
- Software architecture patterns for complex systems
- Graphics programming with modern OpenGL
- Editor tooling development
- Scene management and serialization strategies

## 📚 Learning Resources
